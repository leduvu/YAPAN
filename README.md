Grammatical Structure Identification for Japanese

A web application was implemented using rule-based chunking for grammatical structure identification in Japanese text. In total 628 grammatical structures can be identified by the system. The application highlights grammatical structures given a text by a user and provides information such as JLPT level of the structure, a definition and grammar construction rules.


Grammatical structure information for level N5 to level N2 were extracted from jlptsensei.com. Since the source had only 87 level N1 grammatical structures, the structures has been extended with grammatical structures from japanesetest4you.com.
